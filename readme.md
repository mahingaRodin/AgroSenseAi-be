# 🌱 AgroSenseAI - Smart Crop & Soil Health API

AgroSenseAI is an AI-powered backend system designed to help farmers detect crop diseases and pests from images, and analyze soil fertility using NPK data. Built with **FastAPI** and powered by **machine learning models**, this backend provides accessible APIs for smart agriculture in Africa and beyond.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Detection**: Detects crop diseases and pests using image classification models.
- 🌾 **Soil Fertility Insight**: Analyzes NPK data to evaluate soil health (future support).
- 🔁 **Recommendation System**: Suggests treatment options based on detection results.
- 📦 **Dockerized**: Easy to deploy anywhere using Docker.
- 🔗 **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented endpoints using FastAPI and OpenAPI (Swagger).

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, Torchvision
- **Image Processing**: Pillow
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment-Ready**: Render, Railway, or other cloud platforms

## 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t agrosenseai-backend .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 agrosenseai-backend
````

Access the API at:
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

## 📦 Install & Run Locally (No Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agrosense-backend.git
cd agrosense-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## 🧪 Testing (Optional)

You can add test files under a `tests/` directory and use `pytest` to run them:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

---

## 🧠 Model Format

- Models are stored in `app/models/` as `.pt` files (for PyTorch).
- Make sure model names in the code match the filenames.
